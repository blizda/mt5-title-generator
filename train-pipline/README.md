Before start training, please run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

But, I strongly recommend install pytorch and tensorflow manually, and after it install all requirements  

You also need to log into W&B before start training pipline

For run training pipline, please run python ```run_pipline.py --config_file pipline_config/config.json``` you also can customise training parameters in ```pipline_config/config.json``` 

After starting, pipline do all needed for train job - prepared dataset, train model, calculate metrics, and load model with best score to W&B

If you want start particular part of the pipline separately, you can just run particular script manually, 
with the required parameters, or just set to ```false``` all steps, 
which are not needed, in this moment in  ```pipline_config/config.json```

As a metric, I chose mean cosine similarity, between ground truth titles, and titles generated by models. Experiments log, and models with metric you can find [on this link](https://wandb.ai/blizd/mt-t5-ria-news?workspace=user-blizd)
